excerpt: "Supervised Learning: The value of a home in the Boston real estate market was predicted and identified using supervised learning and statistical analysis tools. The best price a client can sell their home was identified. This type of analysis would be useful for those that work in real estate to aid clients in finding a suitable selling price based on objective measures. <br/><img src='/images/bostonhousing_500_300.jpg'>"
