## Reframe 

I have been asked many times, "What is the best way to get started in the field of data science?" Well, that first depends on what you want to do and/or what interests you. There is not one particular degree or education that will be an absolute guarantee to the field. 

I do not enjoy telling others about what degrees to pursue, as I myself have a very multi-disciplinary background which has been my personal strength in this field. Your background can be your strength, so take pride in it and leverage it to its full potential. 

BUT, you will absolutely need to learn the skills to perform the job. There are data professionals with degrees that are in non-technical fields-but they have taken the time to learn the skills that are necessary. So, first take time to think about what you want, what problems you would like to solve, and where you see your career in the long-run. Next, let's explore what skills are necessary to be a data scientist in 2020.
